                <p>There are more refugees from Syria than any other country in the world, according to the UNHCR. The majority of the 4.2m people fleeing the four years of civil war have found refuge in surrounding states such as Turkey. Despite a new record being broken, Europe’s share of asylum seekers compared with these countries has been relatively small. Ongoing conflicts and political instability in both Iraq and Afghanistan means that many of their nationals are also trying to make it into the EU. There have been 294,280 asylum applications from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan so far this year, with more than a quarter going to Germany.</p>
