The majority of the more than four million people fleeing the four years of civil war have found refuge in surrounding states such as Turkey, vastly outnumbering those seeking asylum in Europe. Nevertheless, there have been 160,655 asylum applications by people from Syria. Iraq and Afghanistan, also suffering from ongoing conflict and instability, have produced 133,615 applicants.</p>

The data from 1992 is not as complete as today's figures, which makes an accurate state-by-state difficult. In several cases only an estimate is possible.
